This code sets up a basic RESTful API using Flask, a Python web framework, and SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, to interact with a SQLite database for managing tasks.

Imports and Configuration:

The code imports Flask and related modules for creating the web application.
Flask SQLAlchemy is used for database operations.
An instance of the Flask application is created and configured to use an SQLite database named 'tasks.db'.
Database Model:

The Task class is defined as a model for the database.
It has attributes id, title, and completed.
SQLAlchemy maps this class to a database table.
API Endpoints:

GET /api/tasks: Retrieves all tasks from the database and returns them as JSON.
POST /api/tasks: Creates a new task based on JSON data from the request.
GET /api/tasks/<int:id>: Handles the details, update, and deletion of a specific task by its ID.
Implementation of API Endpoints:

The get_tasks function queries all tasks, formats them into a list of dictionaries, and returns them as JSON.
The create_task function adds a new task to the database using JSON data from the request.
The task_detail function handles operations on a specific task by its ID, including retrieval, update, and deletion.
Running the Application:

The main block checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).
The SQLite database is created using the create_all() method.
The Flask application is run in debug mode.
The code implements a basic REST API for managing tasks, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It uses Flask for routing and handling requests, while SQLAlchemy manages the interaction with the SQLite database. This kind of API could be used to create a task management system or similar applications.
